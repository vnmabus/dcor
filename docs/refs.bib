  abstract = {We propose a new nonparametric test for equality of two or more multivariate distributions based on Euclidean distance between sample elements. Several consistent tests for comparing multivariate distributions can be developed from the underlying theoretical results. The test procedure for the multisample problem is developed and applied for testing the composite hypothesis of equal distributions, when distributions are unspecified. The proposed test is universally consistent against all fixed alternatives (not necessarily continuous) with finite second moments. The test is implemented by conditioning on the pooled sample to obtain an approximate permutation test, which is distribution free. Our Monte Carlo power study suggests that the new test may be much more sensitive than tests based on nearest neighbors against several classes of alternatives, and performs particularly well in high dimension. Computational complexity of our test procedure is independent of dimension and number of populations sampled. The test is applied in a high dimensional problem, testing microarray data from cancer samples.},

Distance covariance and distance correlation are analogous to product-moment covariance and correlation, but unlike the classical definition of correlation, distance correlation is zero only if the random vectors are independent. The empirical distance dependence measures are based on certain Euclidean distances between sample elements rather than sample moments, yet have a compact representation analogous to the classical covariance and correlation. Asymptotic properties and applications in testing independence are discussed. Implementation of the test and Monte Carlo results are also presented.},

  abstract = {Distance correlation is extended to the problem of testing the independence of random vectors in high dimension. Distance correlation characterizes independence and determines a test of multivariate independence for random vectors in arbitrary dimension. In this work, a modified distance correlation statistic is proposed, such that under independence the distribution of a transformation of the statistic converges to Student t, as dimension tends to infinity. Thus we obtain a distance correlation t-test for independence of random vectors in arbitrarily high dimension, applicable under standard conditions on the coordinates that ensure the validity of certain limit theorems. This new test is based on an unbiased estimator of distance covariance, and the resulting t-test is unbiased for every sample size greater than three and all significance levels. The transformed statistic is approximately normal under independence for sample size greater than nine, providing an informative sample coefficient that is easily interpretable for high dimensional data.},
